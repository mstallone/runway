# Debugging and Capturing Logs

How to run a local build and watch what the app is doing — useful when a provider misbehaves or you're
chasing a startup or refresh problem.

## Run a local build

The project script owns the build/run loop. From the repo root:

```sh
./script/build_and_run.sh          # build and launch the dev app from dist/
./script/build_and_run.sh build    # build and stage only, don't launch
./script/build_and_run.sh verify   # launch and confirm the process is running
```

The script builds a signed app bundle under `dist/` and launches it in place — nothing is installed to
`/Applications`. The dev build uses its own bundle id (`com.mattstallone.runway.dev`), so it keeps its
own settings and keychain and never disturbs a released Runway. It ships no update feed, so it never
checks for updates — test updates with a real signed, notarized release build.

The script launches the app without any `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` / `CODEX_HOME` values inherited from the
shell, and clears the dev app's persisted shell-environment snapshot first. This keeps an agent
session's sandboxed homes (Claude Code and Codex export those variables) from leaking into the dev
app's Claude and Codex data. To test a custom home on purpose, launch with `KEEP_PROVIDER_HOMES=1`.

## Stream logs

To watch the app's logs live while you reproduce an issue:

```sh
./script/build_and_run.sh logs
```

This launches the dev app and then streams its unified logs. Under the hood it filters the system log to
the app's process, equivalent to:

```sh
log stream --info --style compact --predicate 'process == "Runway"'
```

To read logs *after the fact* instead of live, use `log show` with a time window:

```sh
log show --last 10m --info --predicate 'process == "Runway"'
```

## Log file

In addition to the unified log above, the app writes a file log to
`~/Library/Logs/Runway/Runway.log` — this is what to send with a support report. It is capped at
~10 MB with one `.1` archive. Raise the detail in **Settings -> Advanced -> Log Level** (use **Debug**
for full detail), then grab the file with **Copy Log Path** or **Reveal in Finder** in that same
section. See [Logging](logging.md) for the levels, subsystem tags, and the never-log-secrets guarantee.

## Account log lines

The launch-time account pass (which account is signed in at the Claude/Codex default home) leaves a
short trail in the log file:

- `accounts: claude default identity resolved (claude@<hash>)` — the default login named its account.
  The hash is derived from the account id, so two launches by the same account always match.
- `accounts: codex default identity unresolved — …` — a login exists but its account can't be named
  with certainty this launch (for example, an auth file without an account id or an unbound
  account-scoped keyring credential). The legacy card still works; that source can't participate in
  account-aware features until its identity is verified.
- `discovery: codex candidate ~/.codex-work: accepted (<hash>, auth.json)` — a custom Codex home
  supplied a usable, account-named OAuth login and participates in an account card.
- `discovery: codex candidate ~/.codex-work: keyring identity unverified → hidden until its exact
  item is bound` — the home uses account-scoped keyring storage, but launch discovery has not safely
  associated that item with its provider account yet.
- `discovery: bound Codex keyring identity for home <hash>; card appears next launch` — a user-attended Refresh All read that one
  exact item and recorded a fingerprint-bound account association; its card can appear next launch.
- `discovery: codex candidate ~/.codex-work: accepted (<hash>, verified keyring)` — the keyring item
  still matches the verified binding and now participates in an account card.
- `discovery: codex candidate ~/.codex-work: OAuth credential names no account → skipped` — the
  home has a token but no provider-owned account identity, so Runway refuses to guess from its
  path and can't safely turn it into a separate card.
- `accounts: codex card codex@<hash> from 2 home(s)` — the account card was assembled, and the
  number says how many same-account Codex homes contribute local session logs to it.
- `stale account cache discarded for claude` — the account at the default home changed between
  launches, so the previous account's cached snapshot was dropped instead of painting under the new
  login.
- `account identity read skipped for claude, codex: login shell cold and no shell-environment
  snapshot exists yet` — the bounded login-shell capture failed on a launch with no persisted
  snapshot, so the named families were safely left unread rather than assembled from the wrong home.

## Profile the UI

`script/profile_ui.sh` measures popover performance end to end. It builds and stages the dev app,
relaunches it with `RUNWAY_UI_PROFILE=1`, and an in-app driver walks the popover through scripted
phases — a cold open, twelve warm open/close cycles, ten screen switches, ten caret toggles, a
forced refresh with the panel open, and an idle soak. The script then prints per-phase stats from
the log: open latency broken into layout and order-front, close cost, and main-queue stalls.

Run it before and after any change that touches the popover render path, and compare. Reference
numbers from this machine class (Apple Silicon, August 2026): warm open stays in the low tens of
milliseconds to first frame, and the warm-cycles phase reports few or no stalls.

The `RUNWAY_UI_PROFILE` gate is inert in normal use — no timing code runs without it. The stall
watchdog measures how long async main-actor work waits (main-queue latency), which is a proxy for
responsiveness, not a literal dropped-frame count.

The script's "cold open" measures the shipped first-click experience, which includes the launch
pre-warm (it runs at +2s, before the driver's first open at +6s). To measure the true cold path —
no pre-warm at all — launch with `RUNWAY_UI_PROFILE_COLD=1` as well.

## Profile the Memory window

`script/profile_memory_ui.sh` is the same harness for the Memory Explorer. It relaunches the dev
app with `RUNWAY_UI_PROFILE_MEMORY=1`, and the driver walks the window through scripted phases — a
cold open with the initial scan, six close/open cycles (each rebuilds the store, by design), twelve
file-document selection switches, six database-row loads, three re-scans, and an idle soak. Run it
before and after any change that touches the Memory window's render or load paths.

Reference numbers from this machine class (Apple Silicon, August 2026): a warm open builds the
window in ~20ms and the scan lands ~20ms later; a re-scan with the window open is under 20ms (an
unchanged Codex database re-lists from cache in under 1ms); selecting a file document loads in
under 10ms and a database row in under 20ms. The selection, database, and idle phases report zero
main-queue stalls; each open pays one or two ~60ms stalls for the SwiftUI tree mount, which
overlaps the window materializing.

## Tips

- **A provider shows an error.** Reproduce with `logs` running, then check that provider's page in
  `docs/providers/` for what its error states mean and where it reads credentials from.
- **Nothing updates.** Refresh runs on a timer and respects the cache; see
  [Refreshing & caching](refreshing.md) for when a network call actually happens. Use the per-provider
  "Refresh" in the row's context menu to force one.
- **Permissions / keychain prompts on every rebuild.** The script signs with a stable Apple Development
  identity so the permission ACLs stick. An ad-hoc-signed build (a bare `swift build` binary, or the
  script's fallback when no identity is installed) cannot hold a durable approval — its identity is the
  binary's own hash, so every rebuild would prompt again. Runway therefore refuses to open keychain
  approval dialogs from ad-hoc builds: keychain-backed providers stay on their neutral Connect state,
  and the log says why (`interactive keychain read refused`). If Connect seems to do nothing in a dev
  build, that's the cause — make sure an Apple Development identity exists in your keychain.
- **Inspect the local API.** With the app running, `curl 127.0.0.1:6736/v1/usage` shows the same usage
  snapshots the UI uses — handy to confirm whether a problem is in fetching/mapping or in the UI.
