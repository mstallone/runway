/// `.keyboardShortcut` is unreliable here — a hidden/zero-size shortcut button never registers, and
/// even a visible default button only fires when the popover is the key window — so the popover's
/// keyboard navigation rides this low-level monitor instead, which sees the raw keyDown the moment
/// the app processes it.
///
/// - **Esc**: `onEscape` gets first refusal (e.g. backing out of Customize); when it declines, the
///   popover is dismissed through `MenuBarPopover.dismiss`, the same path a status-item click takes
///   — so it stays in sync, reopens in one click, and trips the controller's visibility reset
///   (cancelling edit mode + the jiggle).
/// - **Return**: `onReturn` navigates into or back out of Customize (the same affordance the footer's
///   gear options menu's Customize item carries). Consuming the key here is also what stops a bare
///   Return from falling through and dismissing the popover.
