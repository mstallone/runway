// The UI performance harness. Env-gated behind RUNWAY_UI_PROFILE=1 and inert otherwise: `enabled`
// is read once, every entry point guards on it, and a release user never pays more than that check.
// Run it with `script/profile_ui.sh`, which builds, drives the scripted phases below, and prints a
// stats summary to compare against the recorded baseline (see docs/debugging.md).
//
// Three pieces:
//  - measure/mark: wall-clock phase timing logged to the app log, mirrored as os_signpost intervals
//    so an Instruments capture can line them up with Time Profiler samples.
//  - a main-thread stall watchdog: an 8ms main-actor heartbeat that logs any gap > 50ms. Note this
//    measures main-QUEUE latency (how long an async main-actor task waits), not dropped frames —
//    the runloop can starve the dispatch queue during animations while frames still land.
//  - a scripted driver that walks the UI through labeled phases (cold open, warm open/close cycles,
//    screen switches, card expands, forced refresh with the panel open, idle-open) so external
//    `sample` captures can be timed against the log markers.
