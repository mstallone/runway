/// window-server commit (backing-store reallocation + frame/content sync), and even occasional
/// mid-interaction resizes stretch the hosting layer for a frame and read as jank. Instead the window
/// opens **once per session at the screen-clamped maximum height** and stays there; the *visual*
/// panel — the AppKit backdrop via `onVisualHeightChange`, and SwiftUI's own height-framed,
/// corner-clipped content — grows and shrinks inside it on SwiftUI's clock. The window's uncovered
/// region renders fully transparent, and the window server routes mouse events in fully transparent
/// regions of a borderless non-opaque panel to the window beneath (verified empirically with
/// `NSWindow.windowNumber(at:)` against this exact panel configuration), so the region neither shows
/// nor blocks anything. Outside-click dismissal still hit-tests the visual panel rect, not the window
/// frame (`PanelOutsideClickMonitor`), so a click there closes the popover like any outside click.
