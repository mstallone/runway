/// The popover content: the provider/metric list (or the Customize screen) as a scroll view between
/// fixed chrome — a top back/title bar on Customize and bottom identity/action chrome on the
/// dashboard. (Settings is not a popover screen; it lives in its own window, see
/// `SettingsWindowController`.)
///
/// A screen switch plays as one connected push: the outgoing screen stays mounted — frozen at its
/// pre-switch panel size (`pages`) so the per-frame height morph can't re-layout it — and slides
/// out while the destination slides in from the opposite edge, the two tiling edge-to-edge like the
/// L1↔L2 push inside Customize, on one critically damped `Motion.push` (bounce at full-width travel
/// exposes bare tray at the panel edges). After the push the outgoing page stays PARKED offscreen,
/// so switching back needs no mount — profiling showed the destination mount was the switch's
/// dominant stall. This is not the old two-page pager (which doubled the expensive dashboard
/// layouts on every frame of every transition): the parked tree's constant size proposal keeps its
/// layout cached, and the popover-close reset unmounts it. (A `cacheDisplay` raster of the outgoing
/// screen was tried instead and reverted: rasterizing the hosting view cost 85–330ms of main-thread
/// stall on the very frame the switch started.) Each screen's scroll
/// content underlaps the footer with the native soft scroll-edge fade (`softBottomScrollEdge` →
/// `.scrollEdgeEffectStyle(.soft)`, macOS 26+) — Apple's blurred boundary, not a custom gradient or a
/// material bar. On macOS 15 the footer/top bar still pin via `safeAreaInset`, just without the blur
/// (content scrolls flush). The panel **auto-fits its content**: each screen reports its intrinsic
/// height (`PopoverScrollView` → `PanelHeightCoordinator`, plus the fixed chrome heights), and the visual panel — a height-framed,
/// corner-clipped card pinned to the top of a fixed-size transparent window (see
/// `PanelHeightController`) — animates to that on SwiftUI's clock, with the AppKit backdrop following
/// via `drivesPanelHeight` / `PanelHeightModifier`. The destination is the only live screen tree
/// during a switch, and its height morph rides the same spring as its entrance. Scroll views take
/// over once content exceeds the screen-height cap.
