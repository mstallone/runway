///   secret data. A changed fingerprint or a new process asks the user to refresh manually again.
/// - **Single-flight.** Concurrent readers of the same service/account (multiple Claude cards, the
///   default-account observer) share one underlying read. A caller never waits more than
///   `inFlightWait` on someone else's read: a background caller then reports `.unavailable` rather
///   than stacking blocked calls onto a wedged `securityd`, and an interactive caller proceeds with
///   its own read — the user explicitly asked, and manual recovery must not hang behind the very
///   wedge it exists to clear.
/// - **Circuit breaker.** After a failed or denied read, non-interactive reads of that item are
///   answered `.unavailable` locally — no Keychain traffic — until the item's fingerprint changes,
///   the revalidation interval elapses, or an explicit interactive (manual-refresh) read succeeds.
